        The challenging circumstances also extend to other athletes across various sports in Afghanistan, highlighting the urgent need for better support and resources to improve their conditions and enable them to compete at their best on the global stage.</div>

      <div class="next-text">
        <strong>
          The Afghanistan Football Federation recently announced that the national futsal team will face Morocco in two friendly matches.
        </strong>Officials at the Football Federation stated today, Saturday, June 29th, that these two friendly matches between Afghanistan and Morocco will be held.

        The Afghanistan Football Federation has scheduled these matches for July 10th and 13th of this year.
        The country’s Football Federation has clarified that these matches aim to prepare the team for the 2024 Futsal World Cup and will be funded from the federation’s budget.

       The Futsal World Cup 2024 is scheduled to begin on September 14th in Uzbekistan.

       Despite these efforts, Afghan athletes, especially footballers, have faced challenges and neglect since the Taliban took power. Many athletes have expressed concerns about the future of sports under the new regime.

       Football, a beloved sport in Afghanistan, has historically brought communities together and provided a source of national pride. However, since the Taliban’s return to power, there has been a noticeable lack of attention and support for football development and competitions in the country.

     <div class="flex">
       <div class="next-text">
        <strong> Afghanistan hope to achieve a footballing milestone on Tuesday by snatching a spot in the third and final phase of Asian qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.</strong>The team ranked 151 in the world are on the brink of history and a place at the 2027 Asian Cup under their English coach Ashley Westwood.

        Once on the books of Manchester United, he took over the Afghan team seven months ago and has masterminded a significant upturn in fortunes for the footballing minnows.
        
        They play away at Kuwait on Tuesday in the final round of games in the second qualifying stage knowing they need to better India's result at Qatar to progress further.
        
        Afghanistan held already qualified Qatar, the Asian champions, to a precious 0-0 draw on Thursday in a "home" game for the Afghans that was played in Saudi Arabia.
        
        "When we took over in November just before the first game against Qatar, which we lost 8-1, (if) you told us that we'll be giving ourselves a chance of qualifying with one game to go, we wouldn't have believed it," Westwood said afterwards.
        
        "The players are excited and we believe that we have a genuine chance of making history for Afghanistan in reaching the Asian Cup and third round of the World Cup qualifiers."
        
        India are also trying to reach the final stage of World Cup qualifying for the first time.
        
        Igor Stimac's side currently occupy the second qualifying berth from Group A on goal difference from the Afghans.
        
        Just to complicate things, Kuwait are also in with a shot of progressing, with the group going right down to the wire.
        
        After Stimac saw his men held to a goalless home draw against Kuwait on Thursday, the coach said: "We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves because our chances are still alive.
        
        "I need to do everything in the next five days to make the boys believe they will take us into the challenge against the Asian champions."
